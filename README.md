# StupidUSBPower

This is a USB Stick Eurorack Power supply. 

It takes +5v from USB power, and turns it into +/-12v using an IR0512S DC-DC Converter from XP Power - [Farnell Link](http://uk.farnell.com/xp-power/ir0512s/dc-dc-converter-semi-reg-dual/dp/1860988) which costs about Â£8.50 and gives 125mA of power on both rails.
